# node-content-wip-2024

This repo has several folders of multiple repositories the last Curriculum Specialist had been working on during their contract.  The intention was each would function as follows:

**Learning/front-end:** Client Side Portfolio that has conditional rendering for the weather app they work on in Lesson 2

**Node-react-v1:** Original version of course that may have notes and edits from last Curriculum Specialist

**Notes-app:** A landing page and a few routes and a form for CRUD (a full-stack app)

**Portfolio:** The example one that was built to coincide with a [video lesson](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oDOXwv_e4thHazPizYnEc34VtLbFtQ-D/view) 

**Tester-1:** Notes App cleaned up, lessons for Express.  

----

Projects built by the end of the course:
* Portfolio client-side app donâ€™t deploy right away or can wait to final assignment to deploy
* Notes app (full-stack, same concept as portfolio, deploy on final assignment or after) - mimics earlier Node curriculum but keeps it to one app instead of multiple (jobs, task manager, etc)
* Personal project of their own idea, built in the final weeks
